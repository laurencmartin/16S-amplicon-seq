# 16S-amplicon-seq

This pipeline was developed for re-assembly, a subsequent taxonomic assignment, of 150 bp pair-end read generated by the Illumina iSeq 100 instrument into near full-length to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences as documented in the MSc thesis "**Species-level profiling of the maternal vaginal bacteriome using full-length 16S rRNA amplicons with application to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)**"

Instructions pertaining to installation are still in development whilst investigation into alternative databases are underway.

Scripts and files have been uploaded and are available above.
